# Flood Alert System Technology (FAST)

### Problem
The use of FAST in low-lying areas such as Padang Java is highly encouraged in playing an important role in measuring and giving early warning to the people there. This is so because there are a number of issues that can be analyzed that involve the rise in the water level causing the area. For example, many cases of flooding have occurred in Padang Java in 2022 where the water level is 0.5 to 1 meter deep in a quick time. It has been observed that there are cases of school students who want to go home having to wade through flood water at ankle level.
