# Flood Alert System Technology (FAST)
Develop a Flood Alert IoT project using components like water level sensors and ESP8266 NodeMCU. This project detects water levels, triggering alerts when they surpass a specified threshold. The system communicates through Telegram, sending real-time notifications to a dedicated group, enabling swift responses to potential flood situations. With additional features like an optional LCD display and LED indicator, this versatile project offers a practical solution for remote monitoring and timely alerts in flood-prone areas, promoting community safety and resilience.


### Problem
The use of FAST in low-lying areas such as Padang Java is highly encouraged in playing an important role in measuring and giving early warning to the people there. This is so because there are a number of issues that can be analyzed that involve the rise in the water level causing the area. For example, many cases of flooding have occurred in Padang Java in 2022 where the water level is 0.5 to 1 meter deep in a quick time. It has been observed that there are cases of school students who want to go home having to wade through flood water at ankle level.
